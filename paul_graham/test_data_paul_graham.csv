1,"How does criticizing a project as a ""toy"" resemble criticizing a statement as ""inappropriate""?","[""[9] You can't usually get paid for doing exactly what you want, especially early on. There are two options: get paid for doing work close to what you want and hope to push it closer, or get paid for doing something else entirely and do your own projects on the side. Both can work, but both have drawbacks: in the first approach your work is compromised by default, and in the second you have to fight to get time to do it.\n\n[10] If you set your life up right, it will deliver the focus-relax cycle automatically. The perfect setup is an office you work in and that you walk to and from.\n\n[11] There may be some very unworldly people who do great work without consciously trying to. If you want to expand this rule to cover that case, it becomes: Don't try to be anything except the best.\n\n[12] This gets more complicated in work like acting, where the goal is to adopt a fake persona.

And if there\'s no evidence that could disprove one of your principles, there can\'t be any facts you\'d need to ignore in order to preserve it.\n\n[14] Affectation is easier to cure than intellectual dishonesty. Affectation is often a shortcoming of the young that burns off in time, while intellectual dishonesty is more of a character flaw.\n\n[15] Obviously you don\'t have to be working at the exact moment you have the idea, but you\'ll probably have been working fairly recently.\n\n[16] Some say psychoactive drugs have a similar effect.

You have to find the work sufficiently engaging as it's happening.\n\nThere may be some jobs where you have to work diligently for years at things you hate before you get to the good part, but this is not how great work happens.

They get something done, rather than nothing.\n\nIf you do work that compounds, you'll get exponential growth. Most people who do this do it unconsciously, but it's worth stopping to think about. Learning, for example, is an instance of this phenomenon: the more you learn about something, the easier it is to learn more. Growing an audience is another: the more fans you have, the more new fans they'll bring you.\n\nThe trouble with exponential growth is that the curve feels flat in the beginning.

If people consciously realized they could invest in exponential growth, many more would do it.\n\nWork doesn't just happen when you're trying to.

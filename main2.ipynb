       "4. **Encouraging collaboration**: Funding startups in batches fostered a culture of collaboration among the companies. Each startup received support from multiple Y Combinator employees, who shared their expertise and resources to help each other grow.\n",
       "5. **Identifying promising trends**: Batching funding enabled Y Combinator to identify emerging trends and areas of interest more effectively. By providing support to multiple startups in related fields or technologies, the organization could better understand what was working and what wasn't.\n",

And one thing this exercise shows is that it does have a definite shape; it\\'s not just a point labelled \"work hard.\"\\n\\nThe following recipe assumes you\\'re very ambitious.\\n\\nThe first step is to decide what to work on. The work you choose needs to have three qualities: it has to be something you have a natural aptitude for, that you have a deep interest in, and that offers scope to do great work.\\n\\nIn practice you don\\'t have to worry much about the third criterion.
